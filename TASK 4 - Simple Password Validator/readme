## 📌 Overview
This task focuses on creating a password validation program that checks whether the user's password meets basic security rules. The program continues running inside a loop, allowing the user to test multiple passwords until they choose to exit.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this task, you will practice and understand:
User input handling
Conditional statements
Looping structures
Basic string validation
Logical thinking and error handling

## 📝 Requirements

The program should:
Ask the user to enter a password
Validate the password based on the following rules:
At least 6 characters long
Contains at least one number
Contains at least one uppercase (capital) letter
Print:
"Password Accepted" → If all conditions are met
"Password Invalid" → If any condition fails
Allow the user to repeat password validation multiple times using a loop
Give an option to exit the program

## 🚦 Validation Checklist
Condition	Requirement	Example
Length	≥ 6 characters	Abcd1f
Number	At least 1 digit	A1bcdef
Capital	At least 1 uppercase letter	Password1
👨‍💻 Example User Flow
Enter password: MyPass1
Password Accepted

Check another password? (yes/no): yes
Enter password: test
Password Invalid

Check another password? (yes/no): no
Program Ended.

## 📚 Concepts Covered
Concept	Usage
User Input	Reading password and exit choice
Loops	Allowing repeated password checks
Conditionals	Validating password rules
String Handling	Checking characters, length & type
🏁 Final Notes

This task builds a foundation for real-world authentication systems, helping develop logic used in login forms, mobile apps, and web security.

Feel free to improve it by adding:
